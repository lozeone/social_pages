# socal_pages (Drupal 8 module)


# Introduction
-----------
This module provides a field type wiget and formatter that can be attached to entities (probably user profiles) for users to add links to their social media accounts.

I find the UI on this much easier for users compared to other social media modules in contrib such as https://www.drupal.org/project/social_link_field


# Supported social networks
Supports the following networks which are commonly used on the sites I maintain.
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Pinterest
- LinkedIn
- 500px
- Vimeo
- Youtube
- Flickr
- Snapchat

Supports themeing the links with FontAwesome icons but FontAwesoome needs to be included in your theme manually. This module does not add the FontAwesome library.
